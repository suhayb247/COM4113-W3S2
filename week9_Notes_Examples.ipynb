    "# Brief Intro to Bootstrap \n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap is essentially a library of pre-defined CSS and JavaScript components. It provides a framework for developing responsive and mobile-first web pages. Here's a breakdown of its components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSS Components\n",
    "- **Predefined Classes**: Bootstrap comes with a wide range of CSS classes for various design elements like buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, etc.\n",
    "- **Responsive Grid System**: It includes a flexible grid system that adapts your website layout to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.\n",
    "- **Utility Classes**: These are handy for spacing, sizing, positioning, and more, allowing for quick layout adjustments without writing custom CSS.\n",
    "- **Customizable Styling**: You can customize Bootstrap's default styling using Sass variables, or by overriding styles in your own CSS files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Components\n",
    "- **Interactive Elements**: Bootstrap's JavaScript components add interactive features to web pages. This includes things like dropdown menus, carousels, modals, tooltips, and more.\n",
    "- **Dependency on jQuery**: Earlier versions of Bootstrap relied on jQuery for these interactive components, but Bootstrap 5 has moved away from this dependency, favoring vanilla JavaScript instead.\n",
    "- **Plug-and-Play**: The JavaScript components are designed to be easy to implement with minimal coding required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using Bootstrap\n",
    "- **Speed of Development**: Bootstrap allows for rapid development of aesthetically pleasing and responsive websites.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent design across all web pages and on different browsers and devices.\n",
    "- **Customizable**: While Bootstrap comes with a set of default styles, it's highly customizable to suit your specific design needs.\n",
    "- **Community and Resources**: As a widely used framework, it has a large community and a wealth of resources, tutorials, and third-party plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap's combination of CSS and JavaScript makes it a powerful tool for web developers, allowing for the creation of professional-looking websites with less effort and time."

    "# Setting up Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up Bootstrap in your project can be done in two main ways: using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or installing it via npm (Node Package Manager). Here's a guide for both methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Bootstrap via CDN\n",
    "The CDN method is the easiest way to include Bootstrap in your project. It involves linking to Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript files hosted on a remote server. This is a great option for quick prototyping or small projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add the Bootstrap CSS Link**: Include the following line in the `<head>` section of your HTML file to link to the Bootstrap CSS file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```html\n",
    "    <link href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add the Bootstrap JavaScript Bundle**: Before the closing `</body>` tag in your HTML file, include the Bootstrap JavaScript bundle, which contains Bootstrap's JavaScript and Popper.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```html\n",
    "    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\"></script>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Bootstrap via npm\n",
    "If you're working on a larger project, particularly one that uses a build system like Webpack, you might prefer to install Bootstrap via npm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Bootstrap**: First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command in your project's root directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    npm install bootstrap\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Include Bootstrap in Your Project**:\n",
    "    - For the CSS, you can import it in your main stylesheet or JavaScript entry point:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```javascript\n",
    "        import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - For the JavaScript, you can import components individually as needed:\n",

    "# Bootstrap Grid System\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap's grid system is a powerful tool for creating responsive and adaptable layouts. It's built on a flexible 12-column system that can be combined and nested to create complex layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concepts\n",
    "1. **Containers**: Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required for using the grid system. They are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. There are two types of containers:\n",
    "   - `.container`: Provides a responsive fixed-width container.\n",
    "   - `.container-fluid`: Provides a full-width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rows**: A row in Bootstrap is used to group your columns horizontally. This is a crucial part of the grid system, as it ensures that your columns are aligned correctly and that there's no unwanted space between them.\n",
    "   - `.row`: Use this class to create a row. It must be placed within a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Columns**: Columns are the building blocks of the grid system. They are used to create the layout of your content. Each column in a row can be thought of as a fraction of the total width of the row, with each row being divided into a maximum of 12 columns.\n",
    "   - `.col-`: The base class for a column. You can add a number from 1 to 12 to specify how many of the 12 parts of the row the column should take up, e.g., `.col-6` for half the width of the row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Responsive Design\n",
    "Bootstrap's grid system is designed to be responsive. The columns will automatically adjust to the appropriate size based on the screen width. You can control how columns behave on different devices by using grid breakpoints:\n",
    "- `.col-`: Extra small devices (less than 576px).\n",
    "- `.col-sm-`: Small devices (≥576px).\n",
    "- `.col-md-`: Medium devices (≥768px).\n",
    "- `.col-lg-`: Large devices (≥992px).\n",
    "- `.col-xl-`: Extra large devices (≥1200px).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each breakpoint class specifies the column's behavior starting from that breakpoint and up. For example, `.col-md-4` will set the column to take up 4/12 of the row from medium devices and up, while it will take the full width on smaller devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these classes, you can create complex, responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Examples: Responsive Grid Structure \n",
    "\n",
    "Following examples illustrates how to use Bootstrap's responsive grid system. These examples will demonstrate how to create layouts that adjust to different screen sizes, utilizing Bootstrap's `col-*` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Basic Three-Column Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "This example creates a simple three-column layout that stacks vertically on small screens and is horizontal on medium screens and larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-4\">Column 1</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-4\">Column 2</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-4\">Column 3</div>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Two-Column Layout with Different Widths\n",
    "\n",
    "This layout features two columns of different widths that stack on extra small devices and are side by side on medium devices and larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-3\">Column 1 (3/12)</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-9\">Column 2 (9/12)</div>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Column Wrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "If the total column count exceeds 12 in a row, the extra columns will wrap onto a new line. This is useful for creating multi-line layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-4\">Column 1</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-4\">Column 2</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-4\">Column 3</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-6\">Column 4 (wraps to a new line)</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-6\">Column 5</div>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4: Responsive Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns can be set to stack vertically on smaller screens and become horizontal as the screen size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-sm-6 col-lg-4\">Column 1</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-sm-6 col-lg-4\">Column 2</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-sm-6 col-lg-4\">Column 3</div>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 5: Offset Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use offset classes to create gaps between columns or to push columns over by a certain number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-4\">Column 1</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"col-md-4 offset-md-4\">Column 2 (offset by 4)</div>\n",
    "  </div>\n",

    "Bootstrap styles most standard HTML form controls:\n",
    "- Text inputs (`<input type=\"text\">`)\n",
    "- Number inputs (`<input type=\"number\">`)\n",
    "- Checkboxes and radios\n",
    "- Select menus (`<select>`)\n",
    "- Range controls (`<input type=\"range\">`)\n",
    "- Textareas\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation States\n",
    "Bootstrap provides visual feedback on form validation states:\n",
    "- **Valid and Invalid Feedback**: Use `.valid-feedback` or `.invalid-feedback` to display validation feedback.\n",
    "- **Form Validation Classes**: Apply `.is-valid` or `.is-invalid` on form elements to display these validation states.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Form Example\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<form>\n",
    "  <div class=\"mb-3\">\n",
    "    <label for=\"inputEmail\" class=\"form-label\">Email address</label>\n",

    "# Navigation Components in Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap provides several components for building navigation systems, such as navbars, tabs, and pills, which are essential for creating functional and navigable websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Navbars\n",
    "\n",
    "Navbars are responsive meta components that serve as navigation headers for your application or site. They can include brand, navigation links, forms, and other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating a Responsive Navbar\n",
    "1. **Basic Structure**: A typical Bootstrap navbar includes a brand/logo, navigation links, and optional forms or buttons.\n",
    "2. **Responsiveness**: The navbar can adapt to different screen sizes. Use the `.navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl|-xxl}` class to determine when the navbar should collapse into a hamburger menu.\n",
    "3. **Navbar Color Schemes**: Choose between light or dark navbar themes, and adjust the background color using `.bg-*` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Navbar Example\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<nav class=\"navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light\">\n",
    "  <a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"#\">Navbar</a>\n",
    "  <button class=\"navbar-toggler\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#navbarNav\" aria-controls=\"navbarNav\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-label=\"Toggle navigation\">\n",
    "    <span class=\"navbar-toggler-icon\"></span>\n",
    "  </button>\n",
    "  <div class=\"collapse navbar-collapse\" id=\"navbarNav\">\n",
    "    <ul class=\"navbar-nav\">\n",
    "      <li class=\"nav-item\">\n",
    "        <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"#\">Home</a>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <!-- Additional nav items -->\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "</nav>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tabs and Pills\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabs and pills provide a high-level, tabbed navigation system. They allow content to be switched dynamically while maintaining the same URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using Tabs and Pills\n",
    "1. **Creating Tabs**: Use the `.nav` and `.nav-tabs` classes to create tabbed navigation. Each tab's content is associated with the tab element.\n",
    "2. **Creating Pills**: For a filled-in style, replace `.nav-tabs` with `.nav-pills`.\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Content**: Combine with JavaScript to show or hide content when a tab is activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tabs and Pills Example\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- Nav tabs -->\n",
    "<ul class=\"nav nav-tabs\">\n",
    "  <li class=\"nav-item\">\n",
    "    <a class=\"nav-link active\" href=\"#home\">Home</a>\n",
    "  </li>\n",
    "  <li class=\"nav-item\">\n",
    "    <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"#profile\">Profile</a>\n",
    "  </li>\n",
    "  <!-- Additional tabs -->\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Tab content -->\n",
    "<div class=\"tab-content\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"tab-pane active\" id=\"home\">Home Content</div>\n",
    "  <div class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"profile\">Profile Content</div>\n",
    "  <!-- Additional content -->\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, clicking on each tab will display the corresponding content. JavaScript is required to add this interactive feature, and Bootstrap’s JavaScript utilities make it easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap's navigation components are designed to be versatile and responsive, fitting into a wide range of design requirements while ensuring a consistent and accessible user experience."

    "### Bootstrap Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap offers a variety of components that can be used to add functionality and enhance the design of a website. Here’s an overview of some common and interactive components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cards**: A card is a flexible and extensible content container that includes options for headers, footers, a wide variety of content, and powerful display options.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <div class=\"card\" style=\"width: 18rem;\">\n",
    "     <img src=\"...\" class=\"card-img-top\" alt=\"...\">\n",
    "     <div class=\"card-body\">\n",
    "       <h5 class=\"card-title\">Card title</h5>\n",
    "       <p class=\"card-text\">Some quick example text.</p>\n",
    "       <a href=\"#\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Go somewhere</a>\n",
    "     </div>\n",
    "   </div>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alerts**: Alerts are used to provide feedback messages to users, typically for actions that have been taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n",
    "     This is a primary alert—check it out!\n",
    "   </div>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Progress Bars**: Progress bars can be used to show the progress of a task or process.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <div class=\"progress\">\n",
    "     <div class=\"progress-bar\" role=\"progressbar\" style=\"width: 25%;\" aria-valuenow=\"25\" aria-valuemin=\"0\" aria-valuemax=\"100\"></div>\n",
    "   </div>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modals**: Modals are dialog boxes/popup windows that are displayed on top of the current page for displaying additional information, confirmation messages, or to capture user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <!-- Button trigger modal -->\n",
    "   <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" data-bs-toggle=\"modal\" data-bs-target=\"#exampleModal\">\n",
    "     Launch demo modal\n",
    "   </button>\n",
    "\n",
    "   <!-- Modal -->\n",
    "   <div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"exampleModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-labelledby=\"exampleModalLabel\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n",
    "     <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\n",
    "       <div class=\"modal-content\">\n",
    "         <div class=\"modal-header\">\n",
    "           <h5 class=\"modal-title\" id=\"exampleModalLabel\">Modal title</h5>\n",
    "           <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn-close\" data-bs-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-label=\"Close\"></button>\n",
    "         </div>\n",
    "         <div class=\"modal-body\">\n",
    "           ...\n",
    "         </div>\n",
    "         <div class=\"modal-footer\">\n",
    "           <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-bs-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>\n",

    "       </div>\n",
    "     </div>\n",
    "   </div>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactive Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dropdowns**: Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <div class=\"dropdown\">\n",
    "     <button class=\"btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle\" type=\"button\" id=\"dropdownMenuButton\" data-bs-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n",
    "       Dropdown button\n",
    "     </button>\n",
    "     <ul class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"dropdownMenuButton\">\n",
    "       <li><a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Action</a></li>\n",
    "       <li><a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Another action</a></li>\n",
    "       <li><a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Something else here</a></li>\n",
    "     </ul>\n",
    "   </div>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tooltips**: Tooltips are small popovers that are used to display additional information when users hover, focus, or tap on an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\" data-bs-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-bs-placement=\"top\" title=\"Tooltip on top\">\n",
    "     Tooltip on top\n",
    "   </button>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Note: Tooltips require initializing with JavaScript: `var tooltipTriggerList = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('[data-bs-toggle=\"tooltip\"]')); var tooltipList = tooltipTriggerList.map(function (tooltipTriggerEl) { return new bootstrap.Tooltip(tooltipTriggerEl); });`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Popovers**: Popovers are similar to tooltips; they display additional content with a header and body when users click or hover over an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-lg btn-danger\" data-bs-toggle=\"popover\" title=\"Popover title\" data-bs-content=\"Some amazing popover content. It's very engaging. Right?\">Click to toggle popover</button>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Like tooltips, popovers also need to be initialized via JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Customizing Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Customizing Bootstrap allows you to tailor the framework to fit the specific needs of your project, whether it's changing the default color schemes, adjusting the grid system, or modifying component styles. Here are two primary ways to customize Bootstrap: using Custom CSS and modifying Sass variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom CSS: Overriding Bootstrap’s Default Styles\n",
    "The simplest way to customize Bootstrap is by writing your own CSS to override the default styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Order**: Ensure your custom CSS file is loaded after Bootstrap's CSS. This is important because the last style defined in CSS is the one applied, so your custom styles can override Bootstrap’s styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <link href=\"path/to/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n",
    "   <link href=\"path/to/your/custom.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specificity**: Increase the specificity of your CSS selectors if your styles are not overriding Bootstrap's. The more specific a selector is, the higher its priority in CSS. For example, if Bootstrap has `.btn-primary`, you can override it with `.my-custom-container .btn-primary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **!important Tag**: Use the `!important` tag as a last resort to force a style to be applied. However, overusing `!important` can make your CSS harder to maintain and should be used sparingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .btn-primary {\n",
    "       background-color: #4B0082 !important; /* Custom color */\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```"

    "# Extended Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project 1: Building a Landing Page\n",
    "A landing page is often the first point of contact with potential customers or users, so it needs to be attractive, informative, and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navbar**: Start with a responsive navigation bar at the top using the `.navbar` class.\n",
    "2. **Hero Section**: Create a compelling hero section with a large image or carousel (`.carousel`) and a strong call-to-action (CTA) button.\n",
    "3. **Features Section**: Use a grid system to display key features or services. Cards (`.card`) can be effective here for each feature.\n",
    "4. **Testimonials**: Include a section for testimonials using another row and columns, possibly with carousel for rotating testimonials.\n",
    "5. **Footer**: Conclude with a footer containing contact information, social media links, and useful resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <footer class=\"container-fluid bg-light py-4\">\n",
    "     <div class=\"row\">\n",
    "       <div class=\"col-md-6\">...</div>\n",
    "       <div class=\"col-md-6\">...</div>\n",
    "     </div>\n",
    "   </footer>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project 2: Creating a Responsive Blog Layout\n",
    "A responsive blog layout needs to be readable and accessible on all devices, from phones to desktops.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Header with Navigation**: Similar to the landing page, start with a `.navbar`.\n",
    "2. **Blog Posts Grid**: Use the grid system to list blog posts. For each post, use cards for the image, title, excerpt, and read more link.\n",
    "3. **Sidebar**: Include a sidebar for categories, recent posts, or a search bar, using the grid system for alignment.\n",
    "4. **Pagination**: At the bottom of the posts, include pagination (`.pagination`) for navigating between pages.\n",
    "5. **Responsive Images**: Ensure images in posts are responsive using the `.img-fluid` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project 3: Designing a Dashboard with Various Components\n",
    "A dashboard typically requires a clean layout with easy access to different sections and data representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sidebar Navigation**: Create a vertical navigation bar using a list group (`.list-group`) for different sections of the dashboard.\n",
    "2. **Header**: A top header can contain user profile information and notifications.\n",
    "3. **Content Area**: Use the grid system for layout. This area can contain cards for different data points or summaries.\n",
    "4. **Tables**: Utilize Bootstrap’s table (`.table`) for detailed data presentation.\n",
    "5. **Charts or Progress Bars**: Include progress bars (`.progress-bar`) for simple data visualizations. For more complex charts, you might need to integrate a JavaScript charting library.\n",
    "6. **Modals and Forms**: For input forms or detailed information, use modals (`.modal`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```html\n",
    "   <div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"myModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-labelledby=\"exampleModalLabel\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n",
    "     <div class=\"modal-dialog\">\n",

    "       </div>\n",
    "     </div>\n",
    "   </div>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
